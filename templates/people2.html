                <p style="font-size: 20px">
                	Jimi Hendrix was an incredible guitarist and singer-songwriter. In fact, he is widely considered to be the greatest electric guitarist in musical history, and one of the most influential musicians of his era across a range of genres. Hendrix often favored raw overdriven amplifiers with high gain and treble and helped develop the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback.

                <p style="font-size: 20px">
                    Hendrix, as well as his friend Eric Clapton, popularized use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock which he often used to deliver an exaggerated pitch in his solos, particularly with high bends, complex guitar playing, and use of legato. As a record producer, Hendrix also broke new ground in using the recording studio as an extension of his musical ideas. He was one of the first to experiment with stereophonic phasing effects for rock recording. Hendrix won many of the most prestigious rock music awards in his lifetime, and has been posthumously awarded many more, including being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.
